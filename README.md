# Welcome to HPE NonStop 

This git repository is the new public home of examples applications for NonStop products.

Historically example applications have been shipped along with the individual products and are updated with each product release. The cycle time for each product update varies from a few months to sometimes more than a year.

This repository is meant to be a common forum where NonStop engineering teams can upload sample code and example applications and not wait for the product release cycle. GitHub is a great place for collaboration and we in the engineering group hope this will be one of the places to work together with partners and customers
